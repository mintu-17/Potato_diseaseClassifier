# Potato_diseaseClassifier

This project is a Streamlit web application that classifies potato leaf images as healthy, early blight, or late blight using a pre-trained deep learning model.


Farmers every year face economic loss and crop waste due to various diseases in potato plants.
Early blight and late blight are two common diseases that can cause significant economic losses for potato farmers
The project aims to build a mobile application that can be used by farmers to identify potato diseases early and apply appropriate treatment.
